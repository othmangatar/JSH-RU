## 1. Introduction and Rationale {#introduction}

### Background

Cancer registries serve as essential components of national cancer control programs, providing critical data for surveillance, research, and policy development [1]. The Jazan region, located in southwestern Saudi Arabia, represents a unique epidemiological context that requires targeted cancer surveillance strategies.

### Current Epidemiological Context

The Jazan region demonstrates distinctive cancer patterns compared to other Saudi regions:
- **Cervical Cancer**: Lowest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) at 0.7 per 100,000 women [9]
- **Gastric Cancer**: ASIR of 1.5 per 100,000 men and 0.5 per 100,000 women [18]
- **Liver Cancer**: ASIR of 1.7 per 100,000 males [20]
- **Oral Malignancies**: Significant prevalence requiring specialized attention [11]

### Registry Objectives

1. **Primary Objectives:**
   - Establish comprehensive cancer incidence and mortality surveillance
   - Support evidence-based cancer control planning
   - Enable regional and national cancer research initiatives
   - Monitor cancer trends and evaluate prevention programs

2. **Secondary Objectives:**
   - Improve cancer care quality through data-driven insights
   - Support clinical decision-making processes
   - Facilitate international cancer research collaborations
   - Enhance public health policy development
